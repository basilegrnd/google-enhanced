## How to install

### With Arc
- Copy the content of [this file](https://github.com/basilegrnd/google-enhanced/blob/e4f7d8e35c089b65d4732ed27d472022b6a393b8/main.css)
- Create a new Boost for Google and paste
- Remove the first :root() lines **(! You may want to replace them by your theme's colors â€” sometimes, when Arc updates, all the colors vars will mess up and it will completely break the theme. If you often change your space's colors, you can remove them to make them dynamic, but i advise you to paste your custom colors _so that they stay permanently_)**
- The theme will adapt to your space's colors

### With another browser
- Copy the content of [this file](https://github.com/basilegrnd/google-enhanced/blob/e4f7d8e35c089b65d4732ed27d472022b6a393b8/main.css)
- Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) if not already installed
- Create a new script and paste the CSS
- Replace the var colors stored in the first :root() lines as you wish
